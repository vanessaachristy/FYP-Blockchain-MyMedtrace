# MyMedtrace 🏥

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Vanessa Christy Chandra, a final-year student majoring in Information Engineering and Media at Nanyang Technological University. I'll be graduating in May 2024, and MyMedtrace is my final year project. This project aims to revolutionize Electronic Health Record management using blockchain technology. 

MyMedtrace provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly system for managing health records. The project includes a frontend, two backend systems (Express.js and Flask), and a Web3 integration. 

## Repository Structure

- **Frontend Repository 🎨**: The user interface for the MyMedtrace application, built using React Typescript 
  
- **Express.js Backend Repository ⚙️ **: The backend system for handling core application logic and API endpoints that connects to MongoDB database server.
  
- **Flask Backend Repository 🧠 **: The backend system for additional services, including natural language processing.

- **Web3 Repository ⛓️**: The blockchain layer of the project, managing smart contracts and interfacing with the Ethereum network, built using Solidity.
